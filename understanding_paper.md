3D content creation approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline:
    1. Encoding 3D shapes into a latent space using variational autoender (VAE's)
    2. training a latent diffusion model

Performace of such a generative pipeline heavily relies on:
    capability to faithfull encode and reconstruct 3D shapes.
