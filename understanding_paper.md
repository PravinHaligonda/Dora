`Paper Overview and key ideas:`
    This is what normally happens:
    3D content generation pipelines commanly employ Variational Autoencoders (VAE's) to encode shapes into compact latent representations for diffusion-based generation.

    Summery of the problem:
    (The method used previously)****However, the widely adopted uniform point sampling strategy in Shape VAE training often leads**** (The problem it raised)to significant loss of geometric details, limiting the quality of shape recontruction and downstran generation tasks. 

    Solution it proposes:
    They presents* Dora-VAE a noval approach that enchaces VAE recontruction through out proposed sharp edge sampling strategy and dual cross-attention mechanism.
    -enables the VAE to focus on crusial geometric details that are typically missed by unifrom sampling appraches.

    Benchmark they proposed: (Dora-Bench)
    For systematically evaluate VAE reconstruction quality, they proposed Dora-Bench. 
    a benchmark that quantifies shape complexity through the density of sharp edges, introducing a new metric focused on reconstruction accuarcy at these salient geometric features.

    Result they proposed:
    Dora-VAE achieves comparable recontruction quality to state-of-the-art dense XCube-VAE while requiring a letent space at least 8x samller (1280 vs. > 10000 codes)
