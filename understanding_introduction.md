    3D content creation is vital to delivering realistic and immersive experiences in various industries, including games, movies and AR/VR.

    Recent advances in AI-powered 3D content generation method [list of papers] have transformed the field, making to more accessible to many more users.

    Following the success of text-to-image generation models [list of papers], recent 3D content creation approahes [3 papers] adopt a two-stage pipeline: Encoding 3D shapes into a latent space using variational autoencoders (VAEs), followed by training a letent diffusion model.

    The performance of such a generative pipeline heaily relies on the VAE's capability to faithfully encode and recontruct 3D shapes.

    Existing 3D VAE's operate by samping points on mesh surface for shape encoding and then reconstructing the original 3D meshes by it's decoder. a sample point cloud often cannot capture all the necessary shape information, which could harm the performance of 3D VAE's

    We begin by analyzing the shape reconstruction capability of Vecset-based VAEs. Through careful analysis, we find these methods have limited reconstruction performance, which stems from their commanly used uniform sampling. 

    When computational constraints limit the total number of sampled points, uniform sampling fails to prioritize geometrically salient regions, leading to the loss of fine details.
